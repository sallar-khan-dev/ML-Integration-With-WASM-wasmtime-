# ML-Integration-With-WASM-wasmtime-
This repository contains the successful execution of two machine learning models (K-mean - using Iris benchmark) and (logistic Regression - using breastCancer benchmark) on synthetic dataset sizes of 10,000/50,000/and 100,000 samples. on three programming languages (C++,Rust and Python) for both wasi and browser platforms. 


# Dependencies for C++:
You will need emscripten, emsdk. 

# Dependencies for Rust:
You will need Rustc, and Cargo.

# Dependencies for Python:
